Furniture Sales Forecasting:
Description: This project aims to develop a robust forecasting model for furniture sales. By analyzing historical sales data, market trends, seasonality, and other relevant factors, the goal is to predict future sales with high accuracy. The forecasting model will help furniture retailers and manufacturers optimize inventory management, production planning, and marketing strategies. Additionally, it will provide valuable insights for decision-making, such as identifying peak sales periods, understanding customer preferences, and forecasting revenue projections. Through advanced analytics and predictive modeling techniques, this project aims to enhance operational efficiency and drive business growth in the furniture industry.

Credit Card Prediction:
Description: The Credit Card Prediction project focuses on building a predictive model to assess credit card applications and predict the likelihood of default. Leveraging historical data on customer attributes, credit history, and financial behavior, the project aims to develop a robust machine learning model that can effectively classify credit card applicants into low-risk and high-risk categories. By accurately identifying potential defaulters, financial institutions can mitigate risks, make informed lending decisions, and optimize credit card approval processes. This project contributes to enhancing credit risk management practices, reducing financial losses due to defaults, and improving overall portfolio performance. Additionally, it enables financial institutions to provide better services to customers by offering credit cards tailored to their risk profiles.
